This is a 2D video game written in C# and using SQLite as a database for keeping scores.
Aside from the animations and textures (which are free-to-use assets), it is made by me.
The levels are designed by me also. It is short, as I didn't have enough time for it, so I made it pretty hard, to last longer :)
The way it is designed makes it very easy to add more levels to it.

The point of the video game is to complete it with as many gems collected as possible. It contains a list of high scores which updates automatically after each run.
